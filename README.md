# Offload

A flexible parallel test runner written in Rust with pluggable execution providers. By [Imbue](https://github.com/imbue-ai).

## Features

- **Parallel execution** across multiple sandboxes (local processes or remote environments)
- **Pluggable providers**: local, default (custom shell commands), and Modal
- **Multiple test frameworks**: pytest, cargo nextest, vitest, or any custom runner
- **Automatic retry** with flaky test detection
- **JUnit XML** reporting
- **LPT scheduling** when historical timing data is available, with round-robin fallback
- **Group-level filtering** to split tests into groups with different filters and retry policies
- **Environment variable expansion** in config values (`${VAR}` and `${VAR:-default}`)
- **Bundled script references** using `@filename.ext` syntax in commands

## Benchmarks

Speedups measured on Imbue projects using Offload with the Modal provider. All local baselines were run on a MacBook Pro with Apple M4 (10 cores: 4P + 6E), 16 GB RAM.

### Sculptor Integration Tests

| Run Kind | Time (s) | Time (%) | Speedup |
|----------|----------|----------|---------|
| pytest with xdist, n=3 (baseline) | <img src="docs/bar-local.svg" width="150" height="4"> 726.0 | 100.0% | 1.00x |
| pytest with xdist, n=8 | <img src="docs/bar-local.svg" width="92" height="4"> 447.4 | 61.6% | 1.62x |
| Offload (Modal, max 200) | <img src="docs/bar-offload.svg" width="25" height="4"> 120.1 | 16.5% | **6.04x** |

<details>
<summary><strong>Notes</strong></summary>

345 Playwright integration tests (browser-based, each launching a full Sculptor instance).
Individual tests are heavyweight (Chromium + backend server per worker), so the default xdist cap is n=3.
Offload bypasses xdist entirely, fanning out across up to 200 isolated Modal sandboxes -- each running a single test against its own Sculptor instance. The high per-test cost makes Offload's per-sandbox overhead negligible, yielding a 6.04x speedup.

### Mng Integration Tests

| Run Kind | Time (s) | Time (%) | Speedup |
|----------|----------|----------|---------|
| pytest with xdist, n=4 (baseline) | <img src="docs/bar-local.svg" width="150" height="4"> 345.8 | 100.0% | 1.00x |
| pytest with xdist, n=8 | <img src="docs/bar-local.svg" width="116" height="4"> 266.9 | 77.2% | 1.30x |
| Offload (Modal, max 200) | <img src="docs/bar-offload.svg" width="81" height="4"> 185.9 | 53.8% | **1.86x** |

<details>
<summary><strong>Notes</strong></summary>

5,275 tests collected (unit + integration + acceptance, excluding release).
Individual tests are lightweight and fast-running, so the default xdist cap is n=4.
Offload bypasses xdist entirely, fanning out across up to 200 isolated Modal sandboxes. The low per-test cost makes Offload's per-sandbox overhead proportionally larger, yielding a more modest 1.86x speedup vs Sculptor's 6.04x.

## Installation

From crates.io:

```bash
cargo install offload
```

From source:

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

## Prerequisites

**Core:**
- Rust toolchain (`cargo`) to install Offload

**For Modal providers** (`type = "modal"` or `type = "default"` with `@modal_sandbox.py`):
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) — the bundled `modal_sandbox.py` is invoked via `uv run`, which auto-installs its dependencies (`modal`, `click`)
- A Modal account — authenticate with `modal token new`

**For the pytest framework** (local test discovery):
- Python and pytest installed locally — Offload runs `pytest --collect-only` on the local machine to discover tests
- The configured `command` (e.g. `uv run pytest`, `python -m pytest`) must be on PATH

**For the nextest framework:**
- [cargo-nextest](https://nexte.st/) — Offload runs `cargo nextest list` for test discovery. Install with `cargo install cargo-nextest`

**For the vitest framework:**
- Node.js and npm (or equivalent package manager) — Offload runs `npx vitest --reporter=json` for test discovery

**For the default framework:**
- Whatever tools your `discover_command` and `run_command` invoke

## Invariants and Expectations

Offload relies on a stable relationship between test discovery, execution, and result reporting. Understanding these expectations is essential when using the `default` framework or debugging test ID mismatches.

### Discovery

Each group triggers its own discovery call. The discovered test IDs become the canonical identifiers for the entire run.

- **pytest**: Runs `{command} --collect-only -q` locally and parses one test ID per line from stdout. Output format: `path/to/test.py::TestClass::test_method`. Group `filters` are appended as extra pytest args (e.g. `-m 'not slow'`).
- **nextest** (`type = "nextest"`): Runs `cargo nextest list --message-format json` locally and parses test IDs from the JSON output. Test IDs are formatted as `{binary_id} {test_name}`. Group `filters` are appended as extra nextest args.
- **default**: Runs `discover_command` through `sh -c` and reads one test ID per line from stdout. The `{filters}` placeholder is replaced with the group's filter string (or empty string). Lines starting with `#` are ignored.
- **vitest** (`type = "vitest"`): Runs `{command} --reporter=json` locally and parses test IDs from the JSON output. Group `filters` are appended as extra vitest args.

### Test ID Matching

Offload matches discovered test IDs to JUnit XML results using a `test_id_format` string that controls how JUnit XML `name` and `classname` attributes are combined into a test ID. For example, `"{name}"` uses just the name attribute; `"{classname} {name}"` joins them with a space. This is the most common source of "Not Run" errors.

- The JUnit attributes produced by the test runner **must match** the test ID from discovery after applying `test_id_format`. If they don't match, Offload reports the test as "Not Run".
- **pytest**: The format defaults to `"{name}"`. The `_set_junit_test_id` conftest fixture writes the full nodeid into the JUnit `name` attribute so it matches the `pytest --collect-only` output. Configurable via `test_id_format`.
- **nextest**: The format defaults to `"{classname} {name}"` where classname is the binary ID and name is the test function. Configurable via `test_id_format`.
- **vitest**: The format defaults to `"{classname} > {name}"`, configurable via `test_id_format`.
- **default**: The `test_id_format` field is a required configuration option. Set it to match how your test runner populates the JUnit XML `name` and `classname` attributes.

### Result Reporting

After execution, Offload collects results via one of two mechanisms:

- **JUnit XML** (recommended): The test command writes a JUnit XML file. For the `default` framework, configure `result_file` with the path and use `{result_file}` in `run_command`. For pytest and cargo, Offload generates the `--junitxml` / nextest JUnit flags automatically.
- **Exit code fallback** (default framework only): If no `result_file` is configured, Offload infers pass/fail from the command's exit code. This loses per-test granularity — all tests are reported under a synthetic `all_tests` ID, and flaky test detection will not work.

### Retry and Flaky Test Behavior

- Tests are retried up to `retry_count` times (configured per group).
- Retries run in parallel across available sandboxes.
- If **any** retry attempt passes, the test is reported as passed.
- A test that passes after a failure is marked as **flaky** (exit code 2).
- Without JUnit XML result files, retries cannot identify individual test failures and may behave incorrectly.

### Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | All tests passed |
| 1 | One or more tests failed, or tests were not run |
| 2 | All tests passed, but some were flaky (passed only on retry) |

### Output Files

After a test run, Offload writes per-batch log files to `{output_dir}/logs/`:

| File | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `batch-{N}.stdout.{outcome}` | Standard output from batch N |
| `batch-{N}.stderr.{outcome}` | Standard error from batch N |

Where `{outcome}` is one of: `success` (all tests passed), `failure` (one or more tests failed), `error` (infrastructure error), or `cancelled` (batch cancelled before completion).

The `{output_dir}` defaults to `test-results` and is configurable via `[report] output_dir`.

## Quick Start

1. Initialize a configuration file:

```bash
offload init --provider local --framework pytest
```

2. Edit `offload.toml` as needed for your project.

3. Run tests:

```bash
offload run
```

## CLI Reference

### Global Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-c, --config PATH` | Configuration file path (default: `offload.toml`) |
| `-v, --verbose` | Enable verbose output |

### `offload run`

Run tests in parallel.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--parallel N` | Override maximum parallel sandboxes |
| `--collect-only` | Discover tests without running them |
| `--copy-dir LOCAL:REMOTE` | Copy a directory into each sandbox (repeatable) |
| `--env KEY=VALUE` | Set an environment variable in sandboxes (repeatable) |
| `--no-cache` | Skip cached image lookup during prepare (forces fresh build) |
| `--override-image-id ID` | Escape hatch: run tests against the given pre-built Modal image ID as-is, bypassing all image build, thin-diff patch, and cache setup. Only valid with the `modal` provider |
| `--trace` | Emit a Perfetto trace to `{output_dir}/trace.json` |
| `--fail-fast` | Stop on first test failure. Passes a framework-level stop flag (`-x` for pytest, `--fail-fast` for nextest, `--bail` for vitest) and cancels remaining batches at the orchestrator level |
| `--show-estimated-cost` | Show estimated sandbox cost after run (client-side estimate, may not reflect actual billing) |
| `--record-history` | Record test results to history file after run. Requires a `[history]` section in config |

### `offload build`

Build the sandbox image without running tests. Prepares the provider image
(resolving cache, building if needed) and writes the image ID to git notes.
The image ID is printed to stdout on success.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--no-cache` | Skip cached image lookup during prepare (forces fresh build) |

### `offload collect`

Discover tests without running them.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-f, --format text\|json` | Output format (default: `text`) |

### `offload validate`

Validate the configuration file and print a summary of settings.

### `offload init`

Generate a new `offload.toml` configuration file.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-p, --provider TYPE` | Provider type: `local`, `default` (default: `local`) |
| `-f, --framework TYPE` | Framework type: `pytest`, `nextest`, `vitest`, `default` (default: `pytest`) |

### `offload logs`

View per-test results from the most recent run. Reads the JUnit XML report
at `{output_dir}/{junit_file}` (default: `test-results/junit.xml`).

| Flag | Description |

| `--errors` | Show only errored tests |
| `--test ID` | Show only the test with this exact ID (repeatable) |
| `--test-regex PATTERN` | Show only tests whose ID matches this regex (substring match) |

All flags compose with AND logic. For example, `offload logs --failures --test-regex "test_math"`
shows only failed tests whose ID contains `test_math`.

With no flags, all test results are printed. Each test is separated by a banner:

```
=== tests/test_math.py::test_add [PASSED] ===

=== tests/test_math.py::test_div [FAILED] ===
AssertionError: expected 2 got 3
tests/test_math.py:10: in test_div
    assert 1 / 0 == 2
E   AssertionError: expected 2 got 3

### `[offload]` -- Core Settings

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `max_parallel` | integer | `10` | Maximum number of parallel sandboxes |
| `test_timeout_secs` | integer | `900` | Timeout per test batch in seconds |
| `working_dir` | string | (cwd) | Working directory for test execution |
| `sandbox_repo_root` | string | (none) | Path to the repository root inside the sandbox (e.g. `/app`). Used for thin-diff patches and as the default test working directory (`OFFLOAD_ROOT`) |
| `sandbox_project_root` | string | (none) | Working directory for test execution, if different from `sandbox_repo_root`. Only needed in monorepo setups where tests run from a subdirectory (e.g. `/app/mypackage`) |
| `sandbox_init_cmd` | string | (none) | Optional command to run during image build, after cwd/copy-dirs are applied |
| `post_patch_cmd` | string | (none) | Optional command to run after thin-diff patch is applied, before image materialization. Runs as an image layer. `OFFLOAD_PATCH_FILE` env var is set to the patch path when a diff exists |
| `impatiently_requeue_batches` | boolean | `true` | When `true`, the scheduler hedges against long-running batches by re-queuing each batch on pop (see "Split-requeue hedging" below) |

Set `sandbox_repo_root` to tell Offload where the codebase lives in the sandbox. In monorepo setups where tests run from a subdirectory, also set `sandbox_project_root` to that subdirectory.

#### Split-requeue hedging

LPT scheduling minimizes makespan when historical durations are accurate, but a single slow test or a stalling sandbox can leave one batch on the critical path while other workers sit idle. With `impatiently_requeue_batches = true` (the default), the scheduler re-queues every batch the moment a worker pops it: multi-test batches are split in half and pushed back; single-test batches are re-queued with a counter, up to 3 additional times. The original worker keeps running the batch, while any idle worker can claim a duplicate; the first to finish wins, and the spawn loop's `is_decided` check skips batches whose tests have already completed.

Set `impatiently_requeue_batches = false` to disable hedging — each LPT batch then runs exactly once on the sandbox that pops it. Consider this when:

- duplicated work is expensive (e.g. per-execution billing on the provider, or tests with non-idempotent side effects);
- batch runtimes are tightly predictable and you trust the LPT distribution;
- worker count is very small, so a duplicate would crowd out queued work more than it would shorten the tail.

### `[provider]` -- Execution Provider

The `type` field selects the provider. One of: `local`, `default`, `modal`.

#### `type = "local"`

Run tests as local child processes.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |

Use `experimental_options` to pass feature flags to Modal's `Sandbox.create()` (e.g. `[provider.experimental_options]\nenable_docker = true`). These options may change on Modal's side without notice.

### `[framework]` -- Test Framework

The `type` field selects the framework. One of: `pytest`, `nextest`, `vitest`, `default`.

#### `type = "pytest"`

|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `retry_count` | integer | `0` | Number of times to retry failed tests |
| `filters` | string | `""` | Filter string passed to the framework during discovery. For pytest: pytest args (e.g. `-m 'not slow'`). For cargo: nextest list args. For default: substituted into `{filters}` placeholder in `discover_command` |
| `schedule_individual` | boolean | `false` | When true, each test in this group is scheduled in its own batch (batch size 1). Use for heavyweight tests that should not share a sandbox with other tests |

Failed tests that pass on retry are marked as "flaky" (exit code 2).

### `[report]` -- Reporting

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `output_dir` | string | `"test-results"` | Directory for report files |

| `download_globs_failure_only` | boolean | `false` | When true, only download `download_globs` artifacts for batches that had test failures or errors |

### `[history]` -- Test History (optional)

When present, enables history-based LPT scheduling. Offload loads historical test durations on every run to optimize batch assignment. Recording results to the history file is controlled by `record_history`.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `record_history` | string | `"flag"` | When to record results: `"always"` (every run) or `"flag"` (only with `--record-history`) |
| `path` | string | `"offload-history.jsonl"` | Path to the JSONL history file. Can be checked into source control |
| `reservoir_size` | integer | `20` | Maximum samples per outcome (pass/fail) per test. Larger values improve statistical estimates but increase file size |
| `default_duration_secs` | float | `1.0` | Fallback duration estimate (seconds) when no historical data is available |

Example:

```toml
[history]
record_history = "flag"
path = "offload-history.jsonl"
reservoir_size = 20
default_duration_secs = 1.0
```

Run `offload history setup-merge-driver` to enable automatic conflict-free merging of the history file during git operations.

## Performance Tracing

Pass `--trace` to `offload run` to generate a Chrome Trace Event JSON file:

```bash
offload run --trace
```

After the run completes, the trace is written to `{output_dir}/trace.json` (default: `test-results/trace.json`). Open it in [Perfetto UI](https://ui.perfetto.dev/) to visualize the execution timeline.

The trace includes:

- **Local phases**: config loading, test discovery, image preparation, sandbox pool creation
- **Orchestrator**: scheduling, result aggregation, sandbox cleanup
- **Per-sandbox**: batch execution, JUnit XML download, result parsing

When `--trace` is not passed, tracing is completely disabled with zero overhead.

## Example Configurations

Example configuration files are included in the repository root.

[groups.flaky]
retry_count = 5
filters = "-k test_flaky"

[report]

```

### Cargo Tests on Modal (`offload-cargo-modal.toml`)

```toml
[offload]
max_parallel = 4
test_timeout_secs = 600
sandbox_repo_root = "/app"

[provider]
type = "modal"
dockerfile = ".devcontainer/Dockerfile"
include_cwd = true

[framework]
type = "nextest"

[groups.all]
retry_count = 1

[report]
output_dir = "test-results"
```

### Pytest on Modal (`offload-pytest-default.toml` from mng)

```toml
[offload]
max_parallel = 40
test_timeout_secs = 60
sandbox_repo_root = "/code/mng"
sandbox_init_cmd = "git apply /offload-upload/patch --allow-empty && uv sync --all-packages"

[provider]
type = "default"
prepare_command = "uv run @modal_sandbox.py prepare --include-cwd libs/mng/imbue/mng/resources/Dockerfile"
create_command = "uv run @modal_sandbox.py create {image_id}"
exec_command = "uv run @modal_sandbox.py exec {sandbox_id} {command}"
destroy_command = "uv run @modal_sandbox.py destroy {sandbox_id}"
download_command = "uv run @modal_sandbox.py download {sandbox_id} {paths}"
timeout_secs = 600

[framework]
type = "pytest"
paths = ["libs/mng/tests"]
command = "uv run pytest"

[groups.all]
retry_count = 0
filters = "-m 'not acceptance and not release'"

[report]
output_dir = "test-results"
junit = true
junit_file = "junit.xml"
```

This demonstrates using `sandbox_init_cmd` to run setup commands during image build. The `sandbox_init_cmd` applies a patch and syncs packages after the working directory is copied into the image, enabling the use of the native `pytest` framework instead of the `default` framework with inline setup commands.

Use `post_patch_cmd` for derived artifacts that must be regenerated when source changes — generated API clients, frontend bundles, or compiled assets. Unlike `sandbox_init_cmd` (which runs only during base image builds), `post_patch_cmd` runs after every thin-diff patch, ensuring derived artifacts stay in sync with patched source code.

```toml
[offload]
max_parallel = 40
test_timeout_secs = 60
sandbox_repo_root = "/code/myproject"
sandbox_init_cmd = "uv sync --all-packages"
post_patch_cmd = "make generate-client"
```

## Bundled Scripts

Commands in configuration can reference bundled scripts using `@filename.ext` syntax. For example, `uv run @modal_sandbox.py create {image_id}` references the bundled `modal_sandbox.py` script. Scripts are extracted to a cache directory on first use.

## Image Cache

Offload caches image IDs in git notes (`refs/notes/offload-images`). Notes are fetched from and pushed to the remote automatically. Pass `--no-cache` to `offload run` to skip cached image lookup and force a fresh build.

## Environment Variable Expansion

Configuration values support environment variable expansion:

- `${VAR}` -- required; fails if `VAR` is not set
- `${VAR:-default}` -- uses `default` if `VAR` is not set

## Self-Testing

Offload can run its own test suite on Modal:

```bash
cargo run -- -c offload-pytest-default.toml run
```

This requires a valid Modal API key.
